## Description:

**By Foragers for Foragers:**A community built library of wild food recipes.

**Inspirtations:** As a forager and wild food educator I find that one of the most challenging aspects of wild foods is bringing them home and knowing how, where, and when to use them in your cooking. I built this application to help insprie and guide foragers as they make those culinary decisions. Foraging is heavily based on community, both in practice and in knowledge sharing, so what better way to honor that tradition than with a library of recipes made by a community.
